// About:
// I decided to make Java the 1st project language file for this project (BlazeOS/Peak_Video/) as Java is already working on becoming the dominant program language on the BlazeOS platform (the dominant system language is still C) and I am learning from my past mistake, but with this attempt, I will use Java instead of JavaScript. It is possible, and it is a powerful language to use. It is most likely going to be supplemented with another language. A video platform written in Java is perfectly doable. For this specific project and architecture, it also has benefits. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.

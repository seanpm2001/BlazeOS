// About:
// I decided to make Java the 1st project language file for this project (BlazeOS/BWS/) as Java is already working on becoming the dominant program language on the BlazeOS platform (the dominant system language is still C) and I am learning from my past mistake, but with this attempt, I will use Java instead of JavaScript. It is possible, and it is a powerful language to use. I also don't want to get it confused with other web services and how they program things. It is most likely going to be supplemented with another language. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.

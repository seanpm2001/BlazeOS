# BlazeOS Web Services (BWS)

## Hardware

| ⚠️ Important note ⚠️ |
|---|
| Hardware is currently unavailable for purchase, due to a lack of funding |

BWS (BlazeOS Web Services) has a hardware line.

### BWS Ice

BWS Ice is a friendlier alternative to the AWS Snowball hardware. Its main advantage is that you don't have to manually upload all data through the Internet slowly, and that it can all be placed on a giant storage device, and sent to an [igloo](#Igloo). Its capacity ranges in the sizes of a hundred terabytes (100,000,000,000,000 bytes) to 3 zettabytes (3,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes)

#### IceBergs

#### Igloo

An igloo is a local datacenter where IceCicles, IceCubes, IceBlocks, and IceBergs are stored. To prevent creating a dependency, the user has the option to go to the data center and retrieve their hardware at any time, although you can also have it shipped to you.

#### Zamboni

The Zamboni software client is the client for BWS Ice devices. It is written in Java, and allows the maintenance of your storage devices. Unlike Amazons SnowMobiles, the Zamboni client and other tools pre-installed on BWS Ice is purely free software, with no software limitations. You can even install other software on it instead of Zamboni if needed.

### Internal hardware

BWS hardware is currently not yet available, and is not in use.

#### Volcano

A volcano is a data center for BlazeOS development. It is not for consumers to access physically, but it can be accessed virtually.

### Other BWS hardware

No other BWS hardware is currently planned.

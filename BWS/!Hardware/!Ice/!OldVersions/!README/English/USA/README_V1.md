BWS Ice is a friendlier alternative to the AWS Snowball hardware. Its main advantage is that you don't have to manually upload all data through the Internet slowly, and that it can all be placed on a giant storage device, and sent to an [igloo](#Igloo). Its capacity ranges in the sizes of a hundred terabytes (100,000,000,000,000 bytes) to 3 zettabytes (3,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes)

It has 4 hardware variants:

- [IceCicle - A high capacity giant flash drive that stores between 100 terabytes and 1 petabyte. It is the lowest data tier of the BWS Ice series](#IceCicle)
- [IceCube - A high capacity external drive that stores between 1 petabyte and 16 petabytes. It is the second data tier of the BWS Ice series](#IceCubes)
- [IceBlocks - A very high capacity drive that stores between 1 exabyte and 16 exabytes. It is designed for big organizations and companies. It is the third data tier of the BWS Ice series](#IceBlocks)
- [IceBergs - The highest capacity BWS storage device that stores between 1 zettabyte and 3 zettabytes. It is designed for giant organizations and companies. It is the fourth data tier of the BWS Ice series](#IceBergs)

#### IceBergs

#### Igloo

An igloo is a local datacenter where IceCicles, IceCubes, IceBlocks, and IceBergs are stored. To prevent creating a dependency, the user has the option to go to the data center and retrieve their hardware at any time, although you can also have it shipped to you.

#### Zamboni

The Zamboni software client is the client for BWS Ice devices. It is written in Java, and allows the maintenance of your storage devices. Unlike Amazons SnowMobiles, the Zamboni client and other tools pre-installed on BWS Ice is purely free software, with no software limitations. You can even install other software on it instead of Zamboni if needed.

#### IceCicle

The BWS IceCicle is the lowest data tier for BWS Ice devices. It comes as a very large flash drive. It is the most portable version of BWS Ice.

| Model | Capacity | Price |
|---|---|---|
| BWS IceCicle I | 100 terabytes | Unknown |
| BWS IceCicle II | 256 terabytes | Unknown |
| BWS IceCicle III | 512 terabytes | Unknown |
| BWS IceCicle IV | 1000 terabytes (1 petabyte) | Unknown |

#### Igloo

An igloo is a local datacenter where IceCicles, IceCubes, IceBlocks, and IceBergs are stored. To prevent creating a dependency, the user has the option to go to the data center and retrieve their hardware at any time, although you can also have it shipped to you.

#### Zamboni

The Zamboni software client is the client for BWS Ice devices. It is written in Java, and allows the maintenance of your storage devices. Unlike Amazons SnowMobiles, the Zamboni client and other tools pre-installed on BWS Ice is purely free software, with no software limitations. You can even install other software on it instead of Zamboni if needed.

#### IceBlocks

The BWS IceBlock is the third data tier for BWS Ice devices. It comes as a very large set of external drive. It is in giant cube format, and can store between 1 and 16 exabytes of data. It is designed for big organizations and companies.

| Model | Capacity | Price |
|---|---|---|
| BWS IceBlock I | 1 Exabyte | Unknown |
| BWS IceBlock II | 2 Exabytes | Unknown |
| BWS IceBlock III | 4 Exabytes | Unknown |
| BWS IceBlock IV | 5 Exabytes | Unknown |
| BWS IceBlock V | 6 Exabytes | Unknown |
| BWS IceBlock VI | 8 Exabytes | Unknown |
| BWS IceBlock VII | 10 Exabytes | Unknown |
| BWS IceBlock VIII | 12 Exabytes | Unknown |
| BWS IceBlock IX | 16 Exabytes | Unknown |

#### Igloo

An igloo is a local datacenter where IceCicles, IceCubes, IceBlocks, and IceBergs are stored. To prevent creating a dependency, the user has the option to go to the data center and retrieve their hardware at any time, although you can also have it shipped to you.

#### Zamboni

The Zamboni software client is the client for BWS Ice devices. It is written in Java, and allows the maintenance of your storage devices. Unlike Amazons SnowMobiles, the Zamboni client and other tools pre-installed on BWS Ice is purely free software, with no software limitations. You can even install other software on it instead of Zamboni if needed.

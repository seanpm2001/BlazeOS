# Userland

This is the directory where the users files are stored. Unlike an Amazon Kindle, this is not locked down, and is accessible to all.

I have included 1 sample book at the moment (Moby dick) due to its name being used in a library, and because it is a good book that is in the public domain worldwide. I plan to add some other sample books (such as the laws of robotics) but I likely won't add too many.

## Structure

`/User/`

> `/Library/`

> `/` - Root of the library

> > `/Books/`

> > > `/_samples/` - Contains copies of the sample books

> > > `/_covers/` - Contains book covers

> > > > `/SVG/` - Contains SVG versions of the book covers

> > > > `/PNG/` - oOntains PNG versions of the book covers

> > > > `/` - Root of the covers directory

> > > `/` - The root of the book directory, contains all books to browse through on a carousel

> > `/Software/`

> > > `/TBA/` - (This is coming soon, it will be the place where software is installed)

> > > `/` - Root of the software center

> `/System/` - Contains finalized copies of the system files and libraries currently located below the `/User/` directory, and above the `/IgniteBook/` directory.

# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is still in its early stages, and none of the versions are currently supported for security, as the system is not fully functional yet, and has not been tested fully.

## Version history

| Version | Supported          | Support status |
| ------- | ------------------ |-----------------|
| < v???  | :x:                | Current, not fully supported |
| v???    | :white_check_mark: | NOT YET RELEASED |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

DO NOT REPORT A ZERO DAY VULNERABILITY PUBLICLY!

Please instead direct message me via GitHub. If there is no response within 90 days, you can post the vulnerability as an issue, as part of the standard 0 day security exploit reporting guidelines.

If a vulnerability is caused by an outdated dependancy, you can report it publicly, as it usually isn't that much of a problem.

<!-- Other security currently isn't available. If there are any further questions, @ me privately on GitHub. [@seanpm2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/) !-->

Please report security vulnerabilities to the [Seanpm2001 Mailing list (seanpm2001-mailing-list@protonmail.com)](mailto:seanpm2001-mailing-list@protonmail.com)

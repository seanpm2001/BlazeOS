# SNU CloudDrive

## Usage on BlazeOS

Originally when I named SNU CloudDrive, I had no idea that it shared a name with Amazon CloudDrive (the former name of Amazon Drive) I don't feel it is necessary to create another file service for BlazeOS, so I will just use CloudDrive.

The main repository link is here: :octocat: [GitHub: Main link (/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_CloudDrive)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_CloudDrive/)

The specific variant in use is here: :octocat: [GitHub: Amazon Drive/BlazeOS CloudDrive variant (/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_CloudDrive///SNU_2D_CloudDrive/Modes/Amazon_Drive/](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_CloudDrive/tree/master/SNU_2D_CloudDrive/Modes/Amazon_Drive/))

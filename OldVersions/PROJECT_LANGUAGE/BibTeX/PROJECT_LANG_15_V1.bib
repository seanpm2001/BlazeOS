%% About
%% I chose BibTeX as the 15th project language file for this project (seanpm2001/BlazeOS), as BibTeX is being used on this project, but wasn't originally documented with its own project language file. It is one of the primary citation languages for this project, and it is getting its own project language file, starting here.

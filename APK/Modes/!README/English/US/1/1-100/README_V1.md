# APK modes

BlazeOS will have APK (Android Package) functionality, with 4 different emulation modes:

- [x] FOSS (Custom) - A custom interpretation of APK reading specifically for BlazeOS

- [x] AndroidBLZ (Google) - A reverse-engineered way of running APK files specifically in Googles variations of Android

- [x] FireOS&BLZ (Amazon)- A reverse-engineered way of running APK files specifically in Amazons fork of Android, known as FireOS.

- [x] 11WinBLZ (Microsoft) - A reverse-engineered way of running APK files specifically in Microsofts style (Windows Subsystem for Android)

Additionally, you can choose which version of the APK structure you wish to use per application. For example, an app that doesn't work on Android 7s implementation can be ran in an older version of your choosing.

Including APK functionality for this project is a must, as the model operating system (FireOS) is a fork of Android

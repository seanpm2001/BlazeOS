# Ungoogled Chromium

In my time planning and developing operating systems and software, I have avoided using Chromium. I have decided that with the little competition in browser space, UnGoogled Chromium is an OK choice, as it removes all the trackers. It will be one of the 3 default browsers in BlazeOS. If the privacy of UnGoogled Chromium becomes bad, I will remove it, and likely replace it with Pale Moon or SeaMonkey.

# Silkworm browser

Silkworm browser is a free and open source alternative to Amazons Silk browser. It is one of the 3 browsers planned to be installed by default on BlazeOS (alongside Firefox and UnGoogled Chromium)

## Engine

Silkworm browser will be a rare instance in where I use a Chromium browser type, specifically UnGoogled Chromium. Firefox will still be pre-installed by default, and will be the default.

## Connections

An option during setup asks if you want to connect Silkworm to BWS (BlazeOS Web Services) similar to how Amazons Silk browser connects to AWS (Amazon Web Services) only this time, it will be entirely optional, and will offer much greater privacy due to no telemetry, and no personal data being sent.

## Design

Silkworm will feature a Skeuomorphic design, dubbed `bSilk-W` (Blazed Silk Worm) A Fluent Design theme will be a secondary option (as Fluent Design is close enough to Skeuomorphism in the lead developers standards) There will be no default option for themes relying on Material design or other straight-up flat design schemes (Definition: Solid color, no gradients, no filled pattern)

## Development status

The browser is still very early in development. It is not yet functional.
